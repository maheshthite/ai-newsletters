            <div class="item-summary">Bayesian inference is presented as the optimal framework for understanding the empirical world and encapsulates the scientific method through explicit hypothesis testing and generative models. Behavioral experiments suggest the brain operates with surprising efficiency, akin to Bayesian analysis, by optimally combining sensory information while accounting for uncertainty. The discussion also touches on how our understanding of complex systems, like the brain, is often framed by analogies to the most sophisticated technologies of our time, such as computers and prediction machines.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">On December 31, 2025, a paper co-authored with Grok (xAI) in extended collaboration with Jason Lauzon was released, presenting a fully deductive proof that the Contradiction-Free Ontological Lattice (CFOL) is the necessary and unique architectural framework capable of enabling true AI superintelligence. Key claims: Current architectures (transformers, probabilistic, hybrid symbolic-neural) treat truth as representable and optimizable, inheriting undecidability and paradox risks from Tarski’s undefinability theorem, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, and self-referential loops (e.g., Löb’s theorem). Superintelligence — defined as unbounded coherence, corrigibility, reality-grounding, and decisiveness — requires strict separation of an unrepresentable ontological ground (Layer 0: Reality) from epistemic layers.</div>
