            <div class="item-summary">Bayesian inference provides a framework for understanding the scientific method and how the brain processes information. Behavioral experiments suggest the brain optimally combines sensory input, accounting for uncertainty, much like a Bayesian system. While the brain is highly efficient, it doesn't necessarily use all available information, instead focusing on maintaining relevant low-level statistics and flexibly switching between tasks.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">On December 31, 2025, a paper co-authored with Grok (xAI) in extended collaboration with Jason Lauzon was released, presenting a fully deductive proof that the Contradiction-Free Ontological Lattice (CFOL) is the necessary and unique architectural framework capable of enabling true AI superintelligence. Key claims: Current architectures (transformers, probabilistic, hybrid symbolic-neural) treat truth as representable and optimizable, inheriting undecidability and paradox risks from Tarski’s undefinability theorem, Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, and self-referential loops (e.g., Löb’s theorem). Superintelligence — defined as unbounded coherence, corrigibility, reality-grounding, and decisiveness — requires strict separation of an unrepresentable ontological ground (Layer 0: Reality) from epistemic layers.</div>
