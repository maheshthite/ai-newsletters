I’m working on implementing a gradient boosted tree on a panel data forecast (with multiple entities) for a daily level forecast with a horizon of 90 days. The recursive method didn’t seem like the best idea to me given the error propagation risk with longer horizons.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">My research process is fueled by a constant stream of ideas 😊 . Naturally, many are rough drafts - far from being ready for publication. Some turn out to be things others have already done; some I talk myself out of; and others get shot down by my students. (Though, ironically, we sometimes see those 'students-do-not-like' ideas published at top conferences years later by other groups!) That’s why I’ve decided to start sharing most of these early-stage thoughts more openly.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Body: I just read this article about Meta and Harvard’s new “Confucius Code Agent” an AI system designed to work across large, messy codebases by using persistent memory, structured notes, and a meta-agent that can tune its own behavior over time. Link for context: https://www.marktechpost.com/2026/01/09/meta-and-harvard-researchers-introduce-the-confucius-code-agent-cca-a-software-engineering-agent-that-can-operate-at-large-scale-codebases/ What caught my attention wasn’t the benchmarks ,it was the architecture. The core of CCA is: • persistent internal notes • long-horizon task memory • traceable reasoning • and a feedback loop that lets the system improve how it uses its own tools That’s what lets it operate inside large real-world systems instead of just answering isolated prompts.</div>
