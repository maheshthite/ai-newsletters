            <div class="item-summary">I have been recently using focal loss for heavily imbalanced image and text classification tasks and have been seeing a very large boost in a production environment. For those that don't know how focal loss works: focal loss reduces the importance of "easy" examples so that the model can focus its learning on "hard" examples. Now i have been thinking that LLM models based on the transformer architecture are essentially an overglorified classifier during training (forced prediction of the next token at every step).</div>

The system analyzes short user-written or speech-to-text reports and performs two sequential classifications: (1) identifying the type of incident described in the text, and (2) determining the severity level of the incident as either Minor, Major, or Critical. The core algorithm chosen for the project is Multinomial Naive Bayes, primarily due to its simplicity, interpretability, and suitability for short text data.</div>
