            <div class="item-summary">TL;DR: FIGR overcomes the spatial hallucinations of text-only Chain-of-Thought by training models to actively generate and inspect executable code-rendered diagrams during reasoning. Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Abstract: Our understanding of memory and learning has been largely overshadowed by neurocentric studies, leaving non-neuronal cells out of the equation. The cellular substrate for memory is thought to lie within engrams — ensembles of neurons that activate during learning, whose reactivation leads to recall of the acquired memory. Astrocytes are now taking centre stage in the modulation of memory and other cognitive functions.</div>

This new architecture maintains the quality of autoregressive models while precomputing tokens, similar to speculative decoding, but without its typical trade-offs.

            <div class="item-summary">This video explores a novel transformer model that incorporates latent variables to guide sequence generation. Unlike standard transformers relying solely on token sampling randomness, this approach aims for more explicit control over underlying decisions, such as generating positive or negative movie reviews. The key takeaway is that introducing latent variables can lead to more consistent and interpretable outputs by making deliberate choices early in the generation process.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Researchers have developed a novel hybrid autoregressive-diffusion language model that achieves significant speedups during inference by leveraging underutilized GPU capacity. This new architecture maintains the quality of autoregressive models while precomputing tokens, similar to speculative decoding, but without its typical trade-offs. The key innovation lies in efficiently utilizing available GPU resources to accelerate language generation.</div>

Unlike standard transformers relying solely on token sampling randomness, this approach aims for more explicit control over underlying decisions, such as generating positive or negative movie reviews. The key takeaway is that introducing latent variables can lead to more consistent and interpretable outputs by making deliberate choices early in the generation process.</div>
