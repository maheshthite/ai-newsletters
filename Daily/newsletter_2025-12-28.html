They propose Sophia, a framework that adds a "System 3" layer to handle persistence and narrative identity. Instead of just standard RAG, it maintains a continuous "autobiographical" record to ensure the agent's "identity" stays consistent over long periods.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Hello All, so I have a simple workshop that needs me to create a baseline model using ONLY single layers of Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten and Dense Layers in order to classify 10 simple digits. However, the problem is that it’s straight up impossible to get good results ! I cant use any anti-overfitting techniques such as dropout or data augmentation, and I cant use multiple layers as well.</div>
