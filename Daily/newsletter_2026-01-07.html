We have faster detectors than ever, so we dump terabytes of data (TB/hour) onto the servers, but we still statistically miss the actually decisive events. If you're looking for something transient, like the split-second of dendrite nucleation that kills a battery, fixed-rate sampling is a massive information bottleneck.</div>

While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins.</div>

I hypothesized that for any given token, maybe only 1 or 2 query heads per KV group are actually relevant. Thus, I created R-GQA (Routed Grouped-Query Attention). It’s similar to regular GQA, but it uses a learned router to select the most relevant query heads and only computes attention for those.</div>

After seeing people's thoughts in the comments I got the idea to run the benchmark under more forgiving conditions, where models merely concede their turn after 3 consecutive invalid moves. Additionally, on my first run I had accidently made a couple of pieces the wrong shape, which I was able to fix for this one.</div>
