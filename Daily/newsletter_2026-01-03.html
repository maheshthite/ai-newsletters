While there are existing works such as Maia (NeurIPS 2024), I have been working on a model that naturally develops this kind of thinking. The core algorithm is just an extension of the existing models, with some novelty in how it is used (but the human-like thinking comes naturally), and the results are implicitly comparable or better than the baselines.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Large language models like ChatGPT interact by processing text as tokens, building a "context window" or working memory of the conversation. These models are trained on vast amounts of internet data, essentially learning to predict the next token in a sequence, which allows them to generate human-like text and gain knowledge about the world. The ecosystem of such AI tools is growing, with many alternatives to ChatGPT now available from various tech companies and startups.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Tokenization is the crucial process of converting text into numerical tokens for large language models, and it significantly impacts their performance. State-of-the-art models use complex algorithms like Byte Pair Encoding, which breaks text into chunks rather than individual characters. Understanding tokenization is vital as many LLM quirks, like difficulties with arithmetic or non-English languages, often stem from how text is tokenized.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Large language models like Llama 270b are essentially two files: a large parameters file and a code file to run it. Training these models involves a massive computational effort, akin to a lossy compression of the internet, costing millions of dollars. Fundamentally, these models work by predicting the next word in a sequence, a task that surprisingly forces them to learn a vast amount of world knowledge.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">In 2025, AI saw significant advancements in reasoning models and the creation of dynamic, persistent virtual worlds with models like Gemini 3 Pro and Genie3. However, this year also highlighted the rise of AI-generated "slop" that can deceive viewers and raised concerns about the impact on creativity and trust. Despite these challenges, public sentiment towards AI remained cautiously positive, though debates continued regarding its ethical implications and the true meaning of artificial creativity.</div>

It explores the distinction between Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), with ASI predicted to emerge around 2026-2027 and AGI shortly after. The key takeaway is that ASI will be defined by its radical superiority across many human cognitive domains, evidenced by both its underlying abilities and its tangible impact on the world.</div>
