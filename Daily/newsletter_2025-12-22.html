You can be a vehicle, a robot or a human. And then, put all of these smart AIs like ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek in there. Then, create a delivery economy and see what happens. So, what happens? Well, this is where the surprises and absolutely hilarious things happen. Okay, so multiple agents receive delivery tasks: pick up food from a restaurant, deliver to a location, earn some income. Agents need to bid on orders, not get too tired, invest in efficiency upgrades like scooters and so on. They also decide whether to cooperate or compete to maximize their income. Really cool. Six incredible surprises happened that made me smile. Surprise number one. So, what works here? Greed or stability? Well, of course, stabi…wait what? What is going on here? Well, according to this, greed is what works best. Welcome to the real world! DeepSeek and Claude were the high rollers. They bet big, and they win big, and sometimes lose big. They had almost 70 units of profit, but look at this.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Today we're going to look at Titans learning to memorize at test time. This is a paper by Google research and has been pushed as part of their Nurips publications. So there's a blog post about it and people posted on social media about it and um I have to admit I just fell for the marketing. So here we are. I got interested in this paper and it is a good paper. uh it so it proposes a architecture of a um model u so think of like let's say a language model right that learns to memorize at test time so it can go beyond the current context you can go over a very very long piece of text for example you can slice that into parts and you can go over these parts and you can use this memory to connect to remember stuff from earlier parts and carry them to the next part thereby overcoming the context window limitations uh that are typically associated with something like transformers. So that is very very cool.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Hello there. Today we are looking at the free transformer from France Fur at Farret Meta. This transformer is extending the classic decoderbased transformer with uh a series of latent variables that can be used to kind of make underlying decisions about the sequence to be generated. So for example and that's the example that the paper gives. Let's say you want to train a movie review model. Now any given movie whether it's good or bad will have like good reviews and bad reviews and and just assume for now that these are distinct two groups right there are like I like this movie because of this and this and this and I don't like this movie because of this and this and this. Now if the movie is good you know most of the reviews will be good but some will be bad. If the movie is bad most of the you know reviews will be bad but some will be good. Um but nevertheless right whether your distribution looks like this or whether it looks like this it it really like okay this is this is movie goodness here.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">Hello there. Today we're going to look at on the theoretical limitations of embedding based retrieval. And this paper is really interesting uh because it proves something about embedding based retrieval. So think vector databases in rag and things like this. And the paper proves effectively that there are limitations to what can be retrieved. And this has a huge implications on basically all of AI nowadays, especially AI that works with any sort of data. Or so this paper would have you believe. The title is obviously very very um you know, it's a it's a title that evokes certain feelings. It's a title that demands attention like whoa. We're all doing embedding based retrieval nowadays and there are limitations on it. I will make one change to the title that makes it more accurate and maybe much less impressive. The paper is on the theoretical limitations of embedding based retrieval of random data. Now, we'll go through the paper and I'll explain to you what I mean.</div>

            <div class="item-summary">language models cannot do addition. Um, not really. I keep seeing claims that they can and every time I see this claim, I go again to chat GPT and so on and check and they can't. And uh, what they can do is learn patterns which work a lot of the time, but you can always trip them up by doing something like okay, so if you ask chat GPT, what is a bunch of eights plus a bunch of ones with a two at the end? it will get the correct answer because it will recognize the trick. It'll say, "Ah, that's just one and a bunch of zeros." It'll know that you're trying to trick it. But if now you change one of the eights to a seven, now it has to actually know what it's doing. It has to actually sort of walk up, hit the seven, and stop sort of propagating zeros. And it simply fails. It uh it either chokes and makes up some nonsense or it says it's one with a bunch of zeros anyway.</div>
