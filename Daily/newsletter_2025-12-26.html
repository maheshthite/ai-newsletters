            <div class="item-summary">I'm experimenting with combining Octonions and ternary weights from Bitnet. The custom kernel reduces 64 separate matmul kernel launches to a single fused kernel. Includes some other architectural optimizations like Octonion head mixing (also handled by the kernel, reduces 8 sequential matmuls to a single fused kernel launch). https://github.com/pulseofthemachine/SpinNet-Research The fused kernel is in src/model/cayley_dickson_cuda.py Some interesting results: Model converges quickly, but hard to tell if would be competitive with float models or BitNet itself since most of my toy models have only been trained for 25MB size on disk) The model seems to favor/specialize in various dims for different word types which implies the octonion structure is actually doing something useful (but more testing is needed).</div>

            <div class="item-summary">I am in the process of developing a theoretical framework connecting AI scaling limits to thermodynamics, grounded in reanalysis of Kaplan et al.'s LLM scaling laws. Core finding: my interpretation of Kaplan's L ∝ C^{-0.05} is that it it implies energy scales as at least the 18th power of the pattern complexity a model can handle. This explains why industry shifted from pure scaling to hybrid approaches (e.g., OpenAI's o1) around 2023-24.</div>
