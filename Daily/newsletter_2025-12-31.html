By separating algorithmic planning (Logic Stream) from execution state (Canvas Stream) via Dynamic AdaLN conditioning, we observed a reduction in "Compositional Drift" compared to monolithic recursive models (e.g., TRM). Experimental Results: Benchmark: ARC-AGI-2 Evaluation Set Accuracy: 24% (Exact Match) Baseline Comparison: ~3x improvement over standard Tiny Recursive Models (~8%).</div>

Recent surveys (like the one on ScienceDirect) confirm a growing 'Generalization Gap.' While academic detectors work on benchmarks, they often fail in production environments against OOD (Out-of-Distribution) data. From our internal testing, we’ve identified three critical friction points: Architecture-Specific Artifacts: We’ve moved beyond simple GAN noise.</div>
