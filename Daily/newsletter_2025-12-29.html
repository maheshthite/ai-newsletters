            <div class="item-summary">I’ve been working on a web application aimed at simplifying the comparison of common time series forecasting models. The idea is to provide a lightweight way to: - upload a time series dataset, - train a set of baseline and widely used models (e.g. linear regression with lags, XGBoost, Prophet), - compare their forecasts and evaluation metrics on the same split. The focus is not on introducing new modeling techniques, but on making model comparison more transparent and reproducible for exploratory work and prototyping.</div>
